*AI-Enhanced V2X Solution for Real-Time Emergency Vehicle Prioritization*

---

## 📖 About the Project
Emergency services like ambulances and fire trucks often face delays due to traffic congestion, leading to increased response times and potential loss of life. This project introduces an **AI-driven V2X communication system** to:

- **Prioritize emergency vehicles** by optimizing their routes.
- **Adjust traffic signals dynamically** to create clear paths.
- **Notify drivers and pedestrians** within a 10 km radius of the vehicle's path.

The system adheres to IEEE standards for secure, low-latency, and scalable communication.

## 🌟 Features

### 🚨 Emergency Vehicle Routing
- Optimizes real-time routes to reduce response times.

### 🚦 Dynamic Traffic Signal Adjustment
- Adjusts traffic signals to create a clear path.

### 📡 V2X Communication
- Utilizes **IEEE 802.11p** for low-latency and **IEEE 1609** for secure data exchange.

### 🤖 AI-Driven Decision-Making
- Machine learning models for route optimization and real-time traffic updates.

### 🛑 Real-Time Alerts
- Notifies nearby vehicles and pedestrians to make way for emergency vehicles.
